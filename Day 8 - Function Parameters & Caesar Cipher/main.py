"""
You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

number of cans = (wall height x wall width) Ã· coverage per can.

e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5
               = 1.6
But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.

IMPORTANT: Notice the name of the function and parameters must match those on line 13 for the code to work.

Example Input
3
9
Example Output
You'll need 6 cans of paint.

Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number

You need to write a function that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.

e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.

But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.


Here are the numbers up to 100, prime numbers are highlighted in yellow:


Example Input 1
73
Example Output 1
It's a prime number.
Example Input 2
75
Example Output 2
It's not a prime number.
