#Here indentations are very important. need to be very careful with indentations.

#if you meshup indentations with the code, it will give you an indentation error.
#IndentationError: unexpected indent or expected an indented block

#Comparison Operators
# > Greater than
# < Less than
# >= Greater than or equal to
# <= Less than or equal to
# == Equal to
# != Not equal to
#Modulo Operation
# % - gives you the remainder of a division
# 7 % 2 = 1
# 7 % 3 = 1

Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

Under 18.5 they are underweight
Equal to or over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
Equal to or over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
Equal to or over 30 but below 35 they are obese
Equal to or over 35 they are clinically obese.

# and - both conditions have to be true  ex., A and B
